            <h2>*Process*</h2>
            <p><span><b>1. Marination:</b></span>
                <br>
Clean and cut the chicken into medium-sized pieces.

In a large bowl, mix chicken with yogurt, spices, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, and salt.

Let it marinate for at least 1 hour (overnight for best results). <br>

<b>2. Cooking the Rice:</b><br>
Boil water with salt and whole spices.

Add soaked basmati rice and cook until 70–80% done (grains should still have a bite).

Drain and keep aside.  <br>

<b>3. Preparing the Masala Base:</b><br>
In a heavy-bottomed pan, heat oil/ghee.

Fry sliced onions until golden brown (caramelized). Take half out and keep for garnish.

Add green chilies, chopped tomatoes, mint, coriander, and cook until tomatoes soften.

Add the marinated chicken and cook until it's tender and the masala is thick.   <br>

<b>4. Layering the Biryani:</b> <br>
In a heavy pot or handi, layer half the chicken masala.

Add half of the cooked rice on top.

Sprinkle some fried onions, saffron milk, and a bit of ghee.

Repeat with the rest of the chicken and rice.

Top with remaining fried onions, mint, coriander, saffron milk, and ghee. <br>

<b>5. Dum Cooking (Steaming):</b> <br>
Seal the pot with a tight lid or dough to trap steam.

Cook on low flame for 20–25 minutes (or place a hot tawa underneath to prevent burning).

Let it rest for 10 minutes before opening.
<br>

<b>6. Serving:</b>  <br>
Gently fluff the biryani without mixing too hard.

Serve hot with raita, salad, or boiled egg.</p>
